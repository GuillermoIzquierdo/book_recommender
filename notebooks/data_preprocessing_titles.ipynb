Instead he encounters strangers wandering in the mountain wilderness, three women who will change the course of his life. Through a series of missteps he and the women wind up stranded, in view of the city below, but without a way down. They endure five days in freezing temperatures without food or water or shelter, and somehow find the courage to carry on.\n",

And in telling the story to his only child, Daniel, he at last explores the nature of the ties that bind and the sacrifices people will make for love. The mountain still has a hold on Wolf, composed of equal parts beauty and terror.</td>\n",

       "Take a break from academics, enjoy the Colorado Rockies, fight a fire now and then. That's all Jake Landon expected when he signed up to be a ranger. He'll partner with some crusty old mountain man; they'll patrol the wilderness in a tanker, speak three words a day, and Old Crusty won't be alluring at all. A national forest is big enough to be Jake's closet--he'll spend his free time fishing.\n",
       "Except Old Crusty turns out to be Kurt Carlson: confident, competent, and experienced. He's also young, hot, friendly, and considers clothing optional when it's just two guys in the wilderness. Sharing a small cabin with this walking temptation is stressing Jake's sanity--is he sending signals, or just being Kurt? And how would Kurt react if he found out his new partner wants to start a fire of a different kind? Jake's terrified--they have to live together for five months no matter what.\n",
       "Enough sparks fly between the rangers to set the trees alight, but it takes a raging inferno to make Jake and Kurt admit to the heat between them.\n",
